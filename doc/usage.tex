\section{Package content}

SP is a package which main function is to provide basic objects to build a complete parser.

The grammar is a Python object (see figure~\ref{usage:embed}).

\begin{code}
\caption{Grammar embeding example}                          \label{usage:embed}
\begin{verbatimtab}[4]
    def Foo():
        bar = R('bar')
        return bar
\end{verbatimtab}
\end{code}

Then you can use the new generated parser. The parser is simply a Python object (see figure~\ref{usage:inst}).

\begin{code}
\caption{Parser usage example}                              \label{usage:inst}
\begin{verbatimtab}[4]
    test = "bar"
    my_parser = Foo()
    x = my_parser(test)               # Parses "bar"
    print x
\end{verbatimtab}
\end{code}
