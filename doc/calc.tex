\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents an extention of the calculator described in the tutorial (see~\ref{sp:tutorial}).
This calculator has more functions and a memory.

\section{New functions}

\subsection{Memories}

The calculator has memories.
A memory cell is identified by a name.
For example, if the user types \emph{$pi = 3.14$}, the memory cell named \emph{pi} will contain the value of \emph{$\pi$} and \emph{$2*pi$} will return \emph{$6.28$}.

The variables are saved in a dictionnary.
